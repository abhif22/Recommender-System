1. remove this part from models/movie.js
	,
	crew: {
			director:{
				name: {
					type: String,
					es_indexed: true
				}
			},
			producer:{
				name: {
					type: String
				}
			},
			writer:{
				name: {
					type: String
				}
			},
		}
		//Note there is a comma above crew
	Add this part back when data has been saved to mongodb.ie, after running Persist_Movies2.js
Open a terminal in the project directory (where college.js lies)

2. Run Persist_Movies2.js (Might Take time)
	node Persist_Movies2.js
3. Run Persist_Users2.js (Might Take time)
	node Persist_Users2.js
4. Ensure that data was persisted by opening a mongo shell by tyoing the following in terminal:
	mongo shell
	use movie-recommender
	db.users.count() // should be around 6040
	db.movies.count() // should be around 9125 
5. Go to my_vir_env/flask1 -> open a terminal there and run:
	source flask1/bin/activate
    cd flask1/Project
    python app.py

6. type the following in terminal where you ran node scripts
	node college.js

	Done!
